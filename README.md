# TASK2-To-do-Application-Elevate-Labs-
A simple Python To-do List application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. The program supports adding, viewing, and removing tasks, and stores all tasks in a text file using file handling.          
The To-Do List Application is a simple, console-based Python project designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. This application allows users to add new tasks, view all existing tasks, and remove tasks that are completed or no longer needed. It is built using fundamental Python concepts such as lists, loops, conditional statements, functions, and file handling.     

One of the key features of this project is data persistence. The application stores all tasks in an external text file named tasks.txt using Python’s open() function. Every time the program starts, it loads the saved tasks from the file, and when the user exits, the updated list is written back to the file. This ensures that the user’s to-do list is preserved even after closing or restarting the application.      

The program operates entirely through the command line (CLI), making it light, fast, and easy to run in any environment such as VS Code, Terminal, or Command Prompt. A user-friendly menu guides the user through different options such as:     

Viewing all current tasks    

Adding a new task    

Removing a selected task    

Exiting the application    

The structure of this project emphasizes modular programming by using separate functions for loading tasks, saving tasks, adding tasks, removing tasks, and viewing tasks. This improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability. File handling concepts such as reading, writing, exception handling, and string manipulation (strip()) are used throughout the project, giving practical hands-on experience with core Python features that are commonly asked in interviews.

Overall, this project demonstrates a strong understanding of Python basics and showcases the ability to build a functional, persistent application using simple but effective programming techniques.
